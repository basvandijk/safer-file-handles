0.10

(Released on: Wed Mar 9 12:21:05 UTC 2011)

* Switch from monad-peel to monad-control.

* Support regional-pointers-0.6 and use its overloaded pointers.

* Add separate type for standard handles.

* Add FileHandle type class.

* Overload the filehandle in operations.


0.9

(Released on: Sat Nov 6 15:57:09 UTC 2010)

* Released at BelHac 2010!

* Depend on regions-0.8 and regional-pointers-0.5.

* Set the region parameter of the standard handles to RootRegion
  This allows them to be used in any region
  because the RootRegion is the ancestor of any region.

* Tested with GHC-7 and base-4.3 and added hGetBufSome.

* Use MonadPeelIO instead of MonadCatchIO.


0.8

(Released on: Sat Sep 11 14:18:20 UTC 2010)

* Replaced Ptrs by RegionalPtrs

* Added strictness flags to the arguments of the RegionalFileHandle data constructor


0.7

(Released on: Wed Sep 1 20:11:50 UTC 2010)

* Use the safer Path type from the pathtype package

* Depend on explicit-iomodes >= 0.5 && < 0.6

  The, from explicit-iomodes imported, ReadModes and WriteModes classes
  have gotten private super classes which prevents users from accidentally
  defining for example: 'instance ReadModes WriteMode'
  which would defeat the safety guarantees of this package.


0.6.1

(Released on: Sat Aug 14 09:20:55 UTC 2010)

* Support explicit-iomodes-0.4.1
  Added convenience functions:
  withFile', openFile', withBinaryFile' and openBinaryFile'
  that open files without explicitly specifying the IOMode.
  Instead the IOMode is inferred from the type of the resulting handle


0.6

(Released on: Wed Jun 16 09:11:55 UTC 2010)

* Depend on regions >= 0.6
  (This actually changed the API)

* Added the standard handles again. Now they work properly!

* Renamed Control.Monad.Trans.Region.Close to Control.Monad.Trans.Region.OnExit

* Added System.IO.SaferFileHandles.Unsafe

* Moved the ByteString operations to their own package: safer-file-handles-bytestring


0.5

(Released on: Sun May 2 20:28:22 UTC 2010)

* Updated dependencies
  base-unicode-symbols      >= 0.1.1 && < 0.3
  regions                   >= 0.5   && < 0.6
  transformers              >= 0.2   && < 0.3
  MonadCatchIO-transformers >= 0.2   && < 0.3

* Updated dependency: explicit-iomodes >= 0.3 && < 0.4
  (This actually changed the API)


0.4

(Released on: Sun Feb 28 13:00:23 UTC 2010)

* Catch IOErrors and remove the internal handle from them

* Removed support for the standard handles

(Released on: Sat Jan 23 14:25:55 UTC 2010)

* Make File A GADT again and parameterize it with the IOMode

* Added support for bytestring IO


0.2.0.1

(Released on: Thu Jan 7 22:55:00 UTC 2010)

* Only import encoding and newline stuff from System.IO if base >= 4.2

* Only use DefaultPermissions if base >= 4.2
